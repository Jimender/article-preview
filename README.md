## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Learned about css function minmax.

### Continued development

Explore more about css grids and use it in various projects.

### Useful resources

- [Learn css grid](https://learncssgrid.com/) - CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for two-dimensional layouts to be created on the web. This guide was created as a resource to help you better understand and learn Grid, and was organized in a way I thought made the most sense when learning it.
